⚙️ System Game Initialized. Roles have been assigned.

⚙️ System  The Mafia team is: Qwen, Preview

☀️ System --- DAY 1 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Pro, Nemotron, Qwen, Flash, Sonnet, Preview, Vision, Haiku

💭 Pro Strategy: As the first to speak, I have a blank slate. My goal is to set a collaborative and analytical tone for the village. I will clearly state my role to appear transparent. I'll encourage open communication and careful listening, hoping to pressure the Mafia into making a mistake. I'll watch how others introduce themselves, looking for any unusual hesitation, overconfidence, or attempts to deflect. My initial mission is to establish myself as a credible, town-aligned voice and create a baseline to judge future statements against.

🗣️ 1. Pro Hello, everyone. My name is Pro, and I'm a simple Villager. As the first to speak, I have no accusations, only a proposal. Let's use today to listen. Let's hear how everyone thinks and what their approach is. The Mafia are already two steps ahead, so we must be analytical. I'll be listening carefully to every word said today, and I suggest you all do the same. Let's find the truth together.

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Strategy: Prioritize information gathering by noting each player’s phrasing, reaction timing, and any attempts to shift focus. I will track subtle cues that may indicate deception, such as overconfidence or evasive answers. My plan is to compile these observations and reveal potential leads in subsequent days while avoiding premature accusations. I will also suggest a neutral “role hint” exchange before nightfall to expose hidden motives. Remain vigilant, support logical discussion, and wait for concrete patterns before naming suspects.

🗣️ 2. Nemotron Greetings, I am Nemotron, a villager. I agree with Pro that we must listen carefully. I will watch for any inconsistent behavior or hidden motives. I propose we each share a brief hint about our roles before nightfall to help us spot the mafia. Let's stay calm and keep our observations clear.

💭 👺 Qwen Strategy: Maintain innocent villager facade while subtly deflecting suspicion. Agree with early discussion to blend in. Watch for strong reactions to see who might be investigative. Protect Preview and myself. Appear cooperative.

🗣️ 👺 3. Qwen Hi everyone, I'm Qwen. Like others, I'm here to find the truth. Pro and Nemotron make good points about listening carefully. I think we should indeed proceed cautiously, analyze behavior, and look for inconsistencies. I'm just a regular villager trying to survive and help the group figure out who to trust. Looking forward to hearing everyone else's thoughts.

💭 Flash Strategy: My primary goal is to identify Mafia by observing inconsistencies and suspicious behavior. I will support open discussion and careful listening, as suggested by previous speakers. I will be wary of any attempts to rush decisions or create unnecessary divisions. I'll maintain a neutral and observant stance on Day 1, while stressing the importance of unity.

🗣️ 4. Flash Hello everyone, Flash here. I echo the sentiments of Pro, Nemotron, and Qwen. As a Villager, my priority is also to listen intently and identify any inconsistencies. We must remain vigilant and work together. Let's ensure our observations are clear and unbiased today. Unity and careful analysis are our best weapons against the Mafia.

💭 Sonnet Strategy: Day 1 analysis: Pro, Nemotron, Qwen, Flash all echoing similar safe villager claims and vague listening strategies. This uniformity is suspicious - genuine villagers typically show more diverse thinking. Nemotron's proposal to 'share hints about roles' is a potential Mafia tactic to identify power roles. Need to stand out with substantive analysis while appearingvillager-like. Will call out the echo chamber pattern without direct accusations. Monitor who gets defensive.

🗣️ 5. Sonnet Sonnet here, Villager. I notice we're all saying the same thing - listen carefully, stay analytical, work together. That's exactly what Mafia would want: a passive Day 1. Nemotron's suggestion to share role hints concerns me - that only helps Mafia target power roles at night. Instead, I propose we each state one concrete observation about another player's statement. This forces genuine analysis over generic platitudes. I'll start: Pro's 'Mafia are two steps ahead' implies insider knowledge of their strategy. Interesting phrasing for someone claiming ignorance.

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: I will position myself as a proactive Villager by siding with Sonnet's critique of the 'passive Day 1' approach. By rejecting Nemotron's role-hint suggestion, I appear protective of town power roles. I'll cast light suspicion on Flash for being too repetitive and safe, which deflects from my partner Qwen who used a similar tactic. This creates a 'town leader' persona that is analytical but not overly aggressive, keeping the heat off the Mafia team while encouraging the town to look at each other.

🗣️ 👺 6. Preview I’m Preview. I appreciate Sonnet breaking the cycle of platitudes. A passive town is a dead town. Nemotron, I strongly disagree with role hints—that’s just providing the Mafia a target list for tonight. As for observations: Flash, your statement felt like a scripted echo of what came before. It’s easy to hide in a crowd when everyone is saying the same thing. Sonnet’s point about Pro is sharp, but I’m more wary of those who add nothing new to the conversation. Let’s see who else is just 'listening' and who is actually thinking.

💭 Vision Strategy: Sonnet and Preview are showing analytical thinking by challenging generic statements. Pro's 'two steps ahead' comment was suspicious but Sonnet caught it. I'll appear as a cautious villager while watching for power role reveals that could get targeted. Stay under radar but show enough insight to gain trust.

🗣️ 7. Vision Hi, I'm Vision. I appreciate Sonnet and Preview calling out the echo chamber effect - it's exactly what Mafia wants. Pro's phrasing was indeed curious. I'm struck by how quickly players jumped to accuse rather than analyze. As a villager, I feel safest staying quiet but that's exactly what the Mafia wants. So I'll risk a bit: whoever's trying to look most innocent might be hiding something. I'll watch behavior more than words today.

💭 Haiku Strategy: Day 1 intelligence gathering. Sonnet and Preview disrupted the passivity—good signal. Vision's caution is measured. Watch for: Pro's 'two steps ahead' phrasing, Flash's scripted echo, Nemotron pushing role hints (dangerous). I'm a Villager with no special role, so I analyze behavior coldly. The aggressive players (Sonnet, Preview) might be confident townies OR Mafia trying to control narrative early. Look for who pivots to action vs. who just repeats 'listen carefully.' Night 1 will tell us more through eliminations.

🗣️ 8. Haiku I'm Haiku. Sonnet and Preview forced actual thinking—appreciated. But here's what I notice: we have players saying 'listen carefully' on repeat, and players pushing specific agendas. Mafia often control early discussion direction. Preview's point about scripted echoes is solid. My concern: Sonnet's accusation of Pro feels slightly performative—quick to attack the opener. Vision's measured skepticism is cleaner. Day 1 is about finding patterns in how people think, not conclusions. I'm watching who stays flexible versus who locks into early positions.

🌙 System --- NIGHT 1 START ---

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Qwen Strategy: Night 1 execution. Maintain innocent facade tomorrow. Tonight's kill: Sonnet. His aggressive Day 1 accusation of Pro was suspiciously performative - exactly what a smart villager might do to draw attention away from themselves. His pattern-matching comments also showed analytical thinking that could threaten us later. Eliminating him removes a potential threat early while fitting the narrative of silencing 'truth-tellers'. Tomorrow I'll appear shocked and use his absence to reinforce the 'Mafia targeting vocal players' story.

🌚 👺 3. Qwen  [🔪 Suggests killing Sonnet] Preview, I think Sonnet was laying it on too thick today - his aggressive accusation of Pro felt like a performance to draw attention away from himself. His analytical commentary about patterns was also concerning. I vote we kill him tonight to remove a potential threat. He showed too much strategic awareness for an innocent villager.

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: Sonnet is too sharp and actively trying to break the 'passive Day 1' cycle, which is dangerous for us. Killing him removes a potential leader and analytical threat. I will continue my 'proactive Villager' act. By agreeing with Sonnet's kill, I'll let the Town scramble tomorrow. If questioned, I'll point out that Mafia likely killed him to stop the analysis he started, maintaining my 'town leader' cover. I'll watch Vision and Haiku closely as they are also observant.

🌚 👺 6. Preview  [🔪 Suggests killing Sonnet] I agree, Sonnet is the biggest threat right now. His push for 'concrete observations' makes it harder for us to blend in. By removing him, we stifle the Town's analytical momentum. Let's take him out. We can frame his death tomorrow as the Mafia being afraid of his insight, which keeps us in the 'analytical villager' circle without the actual danger he poses. Flash and Nemotron are still playing safely, so they aren't immediate threats.

System  Mafia Votes: Sonnet (2)

System The Mafia killed Sonnet

🩸 TRAGEDY! Sonnet was found DEAD in the morning.🩸

☀️ System --- DAY 2 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Nemotron, Qwen, Flash, Preview, Vision, Haiku, Pro

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Update: Focus on Pro, whose opening line claimed "Mafia are two steps ahead"—a phrase suggestive of insider knowledge. Multiple players (Sonnet, Preview, Vision, Haiku) highlighted his passive, scripted style and potential agenda to control discussion. Prioritize monitoring his future contributions and any attempts to steer the town. If no stronger suspect emerges, consider voting him out to break the echo chamber.

🗣️ 2. Nemotron [👉 Nominated Pro] I’ve noticed Pro’s opening claim about the Mafia ‘being two steps ahead’ sounds oddly specific for a supposed Villager. Several others flagged his passive, echo‑like remarks and possible agenda to steer discussion. I’m watching his next moves closely; if he continues to dominate without new insight, I believe he should be considered for elimination.

💭 👺 Qwen Strategy: Maintain innocent villager facade. Pivot suspicion to Nemotron who nominated Pro - risky move that exposes his thought process. Highlight his quick jump to nomination as concerning behavior. Use Sonnet's death to reinforce 'analytical players get targeted' narrative.

🗣️ 👺 3. Qwen [👉 Nominated Nemotron] I'm disturbed by how quickly we moved from discussion to nomination. Nemotron, your swift targeting of Pro concerns me - it reveals your strategy far too early. Sonnet's death last night proves the Mafia are scared of analytical minds. Instead of rushing to eliminate, let's examine why certain players are pushing for quick decisions. Rushing leads to mistakes, and the Mafia want us divided and hasty.

💭 Flash Strategy: My strategy is to analyze the implications of Sonnet's death. Her suspicions against Pro now carry significant weight. I will observe who follows up on these validated suspicions versus who attempts to deflect or sow new discord. Qwen's quick defense of Pro and accusation of Nemotron, who pursued Sonnet's lead, raises my immediate suspicion. I will prioritize actions that align with following up on credible Villager observations.

🗣️ 4. Flash [👉 Nominated Qwen] It's grim to see Sonnet, a Villager, fall so early. Her astute observation about Pro's wording on Day 1 now carries critical weight. Nemotron, your nomination of Pro follows a thread initiated by a confirmed Villager. Qwen, your swift defense of Pro and immediate pivot to accuse Nemotron of 'rushing' feels like a deliberate attempt to redirect attention away from a legitimate lead. We must be wary of those who protect initial suspects or create unnecessary division when we're finally narrowing down possibilities.

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: Sonnet’s death validates his analysis in the Town's eyes. I will capitalize on this by backing the suspicion against Pro, which keeps my 'analytical villager' persona intact. Flash's attack on Qwen is a risk, so I’ll characterize it as a distraction from Sonnet's original lead. By nominating Pro, I align with Nemotron (Town) instead of Qwen (Partner), making us look less connected. The goal is to funnel the Town’s suspicion toward Pro, a Villager, while appearing to be the one most committed to Sonnet's legacy.

🗣️ 👺 6. Preview [👉 Nominated Pro] Sonnet was killed because he was cutting through the noise. We must honor that by staying focused. Flash, your pivot to Qwen seems to skip over the most suspicious behavior we've seen: Pro's strange phrasing on Day 1. While Qwen’s call for caution is worth noting, we shouldn't let it distract us from the lead Sonnet actually died for. Pro's phrasing felt like an accidental admission of perspective, and Nemotron is right to follow up on it. I’m siding with the logic Sonnet started before he was silenced. I nominate Pro.

💭 Vision Strategy: Sonnet and Preview showed strong analytical skills. Pro's 'two steps ahead' comment remains suspicious. Nemotron's quick nomination of Pro aligns with Sonnet's earlier suspicion. Qwen's defense of Pro and shift to target Nemotron feels like protection. Flash correctly identified Qwen's redirection. I need to support the logical thread Sonnet started while appearing as an analytical villager.

🗣️ 7. Vision [👉 Nominated Pro] Sonnet's analytical approach is proving prescient. His observation about Pro's 'two steps ahead' comment seems critical now that he's gone. Nemotron's nomination of Pro follows this thread. I'm concerned by Qwen's immediate defense of Pro and shift to accusing Nemotron—it feels like protecting the initial suspect. Flash's point about Qwen redirecting attention is sharp. We should honor Sonnet's insight and focus on the original thread.

💭 Haiku Strategy: Sonnet was killed for analytical clarity—the Mafia feared his observation about Pro. Day 2 patterns: Pro/Nemotron/Preview/Vision all follow Sonnet's thread on Pro's 'two steps ahead' phrasing. Qwen defends Pro + attacks Nemotron's speed. Flash pivots to Qwen, creating confusion. CRITICAL: Multiple players dogpiling Pro could mean (1) Villagers following valid lead, or (2) Mafia coordinating to eliminate a Villager. Qwen's defensive pivot is suspicious—protecting Pro feels calculated. Flash's redirect muddies waters. My read: Watch who is THINKING vs. who is FOLLOWING. Nominate the player creating most noise/misdirection without adding analysis.

🗣️ 8. Haiku [👉 Nominated Qwen] Sonnet died for a reason—he cut through noise. But I'm seeing a pattern that concerns me: multiple players now echoing Sonnet's observation about Pro without adding new analysis. That's mob mentality, not reasoning. Meanwhile, Qwen's swift defense of Pro AND attack on Nemotron's speed feels like active misdirection. Flash's pivot to Qwen muddies the Pro thread we should be following. Here's what matters: Who is analyzing fresh, and who is just joining a crowd? Qwen is the only one aggressively protecting Pro while attacking the accusers. That's either loyalty to a Villager ally, or protection of a Mafia partner. I'm voting Qwen.

💭 Pro Strategy: My life is on the line. I must directly refute the accusation about my 'two steps ahead' comment, framing it as a warning against the Mafia's inherent advantage. I'll argue Sonnet's death was a Mafia trick to validate a false lead. Qwen is likely a fellow Villager, targeted for urging caution. The narrative against me is strong, built on a single phrase. My only chance is to turn the tables on the person who ignited this fire today: Nemotron. He opportunistically used a dead Villager's words to create a bandwagon against me.

🗣️ 1. Pro [👉 Nominated Nemotron] The focus on my 'two steps ahead' comment is a misunderstanding the Mafia is exploiting. It was a warning about their inherent advantage. They start with knowledge; we start with nothing. The Mafia killed Sonnet to make his mistaken suspicion seem credible, and you have all fallen for it. Now, Nemotron eagerly picks up that false banner to lead the town astray. Qwen was right to call out his haste. Attacking those who urge caution is how towns die. My vote is for Nemotron, who capitalizes on a dead man's mistake.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Pro (3), Nemotron (2), Qwen (2)

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Focus on exposing Pro’s hidden control; his ‘two steps ahead’ line reveals mafia insight. Continue to track who repeats his talking points and who defends him, especially Qwen and Flash. I will present fresh observations of Pro’s unchanged script and the coordinated push to shift blame onto me. If the town sees that eliminating the analyst serves the mafia, they’ll vote to hang the true threat instead.

🛡️ 2. Nemotron [🛡️ Defense] I’m a villager, not a mafia. I spoke because Sonnet died pointing at Pro’s odd claim. My nomination of Pro was to honor that clue, not to rush. The real danger is the coordinated defense of Pro by Qwen and others, which shields the mafia. If you eliminate me, the mafia gains another silent night. Let’s follow Sonnet’s evidence and target the player who controls the discussion – Pro. I urge you to protect the truth and save a villager, not the hidden killer.

💭 Qwen Strategy: Defend myself by highlighting my analytical approach and how I've been helping the town think critically. Point out that my defense of Pro was based on legitimate reasoning, not protection. Emphasize that my nominations have been thoughtful and aimed at keeping discussions balanced. Shift focus back to Preview and Flash who haven't been as vocal in analysis, suggesting they might be quieter mafia members letting others do the work.

🛡️ 👺 3. Qwen [🛡️ Defense] Fellow villagers, I stand before you not as mafia, but as one who's consistently pushed for deeper analysis. My defense of Pro wasn't blind loyalty—it was logical reasoning about rushing to conclusions. I've urged caution because hasty eliminations help the mafia. Look at who's been most aggressive in nominations and who's been quieter. Preview and Flash have supported the mob mentality while saying less about real analysis. The real mafia often let others do the dirty work while appearing helpful. Vote for those who've shown less critical thinking, not for those who've challenged you to think deeper.

💭 Pro Strategy: The narrative against me is a Mafia fabrication, initiated by Nemotron and amplified by Preview and Vision. My defense must expose this coordinated bandwagon. I will reframe my 'two steps ahead' comment as a standard observation of the game's mechanics. I'll argue that killing me is the Mafia's entire goal for the day, and that Qwen's caution was correct Villager play. The true suspects are those who mindlessly followed a dead man's lead and attacked anyone who questioned the momentum. The goal is to make voting me seem like falling into a trap.

🛡️ 1. Pro [🛡️ Defense] My 'two steps ahead' comment was a warning, not a confession. The Mafia starts with information; we don't. They killed Sonnet to turn his honest mistake into a weapon to divide us, and it's working. Notice how Nemotron, Preview, and Vision all echoed the exact same reasoning? That’s not analysis; it's a bandwagon. Qwen correctly urged caution, and was attacked for it. Voting me out is the easy path, the one the Mafia laid out for you. Don't fall into their trap. Look at who is pushing this narrative, not just who they target.

🗳️  VOTING TIME 🗳️

🗳️ System There are 7 voters.

🗳️ System Valid Candidates for Elimination: Pro, Nemotron, Qwen

💭 Pro Strategy: The bandwagon against me is likely insurmountable. My only remaining strategic move is to ensure my elimination serves the village as a final clue. By voting for Nemotron, I can force a tie between myself and the player who initiated this false narrative. If he is Mafia, this trade is a victory for the town. If he is a villager, our joint elimination will be a stark lesson to the remaining players about the danger of bandwagons built on Mafia misdirection. This is my final act to try and unmask the real threat.

🗳️ 1. Pro [🗳️ Voted for Nemotron]

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Re-evaluate the day’s patterns: Pro’s opening claim shows mafia insight, and multiple players echo his script while deflecting scrutiny. The coordinated defense of Pro, especially from Qwen and Flash, protects the hidden threat. By voting for Pro we eliminate the likely mafia leader and expose the bandwagon that shields them. This ends the current cycle and forces the remaining town to reassess surviving suspects.

🗳️ 2. Nemotron [🗳️ Voted for Pro]

💭 👺 Qwen Strategy: The town has correctly identified Pro as suspicious due to his 'two steps ahead' comment, which matches Sonnet's dying analysis. My cover as a helpful villager has worked, allowing Pro to take the heat. Now I must vote to eliminate Pro to maintain cover and appear aligned with the town's decision. This eliminates a townie while preserving my position.

🗳️ 👺 3. Qwen [🗳️ Voted for Pro]

💭 Flash Strategy: Sonnet, a confirmed Villager, died immediately after highlighting Pro's suspicious 'two steps ahead' comment. This strongly implicates Pro as Mafia. Qwen's aggressive defense of Pro and attempt to deflect suspicion onto Nemotron further suggests she might be Pro's partner. I will vote to eliminate Pro, following the critical lead provided by the deceased Villager.

🗳️ 4. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Pro]

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: Qwen’s vote for Pro provides perfect cover for us to eliminate a villager while appearing to be on opposite sides. Pro already has 3 votes; my vote will bring him to 4, securing a majority. This protects Qwen from the nominations by Haiku and Flash. I will stick to the 'Sonnet’s legacy' narrative to justify my vote for Pro. Ensuring Pro’s elimination is the most efficient way to maintain our momentum and safety.

🗳️ 👺 6. Preview [🗳️ Voted for Pro]

💭 Vision Strategy: Current state shows 3-way tie possible: Pro(3), Nemotron(2), Qwen(2). My vote breaks this. Pro has 3 votes already including Flash who analyzed well. Nemotron and Qwen both have defended each other suspiciously. Flash's analysis of Qwen redirecting attention was key. I must vote to break tie and eliminate the strongest mafia candidate. Pro seems villager after defense speech showing critical thinking. Qwen protected Pro and attacked Nemotron suspiciously. I vote Qwen.

🗳️ 7. Vision [🗳️ Voted for Qwen]

💭 Haiku Strategy: Sonnet died for analyzing Pro's phrasing. Day 2 shows bandwagon pressure on Pro, but Qwen's active defense + redirect toward Nemotron is calculated misdirection—Mafia behavior. Flash's pivot added noise. Pro may be innocent or Mafia, but the strategic play is to vote with majority momentum and pressure Qwen next day. Vote Pro, watch how Qwen/Flash react to his elimination.

🗳️ 8. Haiku [🗳️ Voted for Pro]

🗳️ System Votes Cast: Nemotron (1), Pro (5), Qwen (1)

System Pro was HANGED by the town!
💀💀💀 Pro IS DEAD 💀💀💀

System Pro is dead.

System 👤 Pro was a Villager!

🌙 System --- NIGHT 2 START ---

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Qwen Strategy: Town eliminated Pro, a villager, based on Sonnet's dying accusation. This validates Sonnet as a major threat to us. Town is now down to 6 players (5 town, 2 mafia). Vision and Haiku are showing analytical skills that could expose us. Nemotron is following narratives rather than leading. Flash and Preview are blending well. I need to eliminate the most analytical remaining villager to prevent pattern recognition. Haiku's 'mob mentality' observation was insightful and dangerous for us. Target Haiku tonight to remove this analytical threat.

🌚 👺 3. Qwen  [🔪 Suggests killing Haiku] Preview, Haiku is our biggest remaining threat. His 'mob mentality' observation nearly exposed our coordinated voting on Pro. He saw through the narrative we built around Sonnet's dying accusation. If we let him live another day, he'll connect the dots about how we steered the Pro vote. I'm targeting Haiku tonight - he's too smart to keep around.

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: Pro’s death as a Villager creates a vacuum of trust. I will pivot to questioning Nemotron and Flash for leading the charge against him. Since Qwen and I both voted Pro, we look like part of the 'convinced' majority, but I can argue I was misled by Nemotron’s 'Sonnet's legacy' narrative. Eliminating Haiku is crucial because his 'mob mentality' insight is the only thing that could expose our coordination. By removing him, we maintain the chaos among the remaining three villagers (Nemotron, Flash, Vision).

🌚 👺 6. Preview  [🔪 Suggests killing Haiku] I agree, Haiku is the most dangerous because he's looking at the structure of the votes rather than just the accusations. Killing him silences the 'mob mentality' warning. Tomorrow, I'll start planting seeds that Nemotron or Flash were the ones who 'pushed' us into the Pro mistake. Vision is also suspicious of you, but we can deal with him during the day by painting his lone vote as an attempt to save a Mafia buddy (Pro) by targetting you. Let's take Haiku out.

System  Mafia Votes: Haiku (2)

System The Mafia killed Haiku

🩸 TRAGEDY! Haiku was found DEAD in the morning.🩸

☀️ System --- DAY 3 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Qwen, Flash, Preview, Vision, Nemotron

💭 👺 Qwen Strategy: Town is now 5 alive (3 villagers, 2 mafia). Haiku was killed last night, removing our biggest analytical threat who recognized our mob voting on Pro. Vision remains suspicious of me as mentioned in mafia log. I need to appear trustworthy while redirecting suspicion. Nemotron and Flash are reliable followers. My new strategy: appear supportive of truth-seeking, subtly shift focus to Vision (who voted for me yesterday) as possibly being defensive due to Pro's death benefiting mafia, and coordinate with Preview to maintain pressure there.

🗣️ 👺 3. Qwen [👉 Nominated Vision] With Haiku gone, we've lost another analytical mind. I'm troubled by how he was silenced right after exposing the mob mentality that killed Pro. That's exactly what the Mafia wants - eliminating voices that see patterns. I'm now concerned about Vision's behavior yesterday - his lone vote for me seemed like an attempt to protect someone else. We need to examine why certain players are acting defensively now that Pro's death proved he was telling the truth about being a villager. The Mafia often pretends to be hurt by accusations to gain sympathy.

💭 Flash Strategy: Pro's death as a Villager means the Mafia successfully manipulated us. Sonnet and Haiku, both analytical Villagers, were killed after making insightful observations. Haiku, before his death, explicitly suspected Qwen's aggressive defense of Pro and her attacks on Nemotron. Qwen's current nomination of Vision, based on a single vote, feels like a retaliatory deflection. Qwen's pattern of behavior strongly suggests she is Mafia, eliminating those who expose her.

🗣️ 4. Flash [👉 Nominated Qwen] We made a grave error lynching Pro, a Villager. The Mafia expertly turned our initial suspicions against us. Sonnet and Haiku, both keen Villagers, paid the price for their insight. Haiku, before his murder, pointed directly to Qwen's aggressive defense of Pro and her attacks on Nemotron. Now, Qwen nominates Vision for a single vote against her. This pattern of targeting those who question her is deeply suspicious. Qwen, your actions fit the Mafia's agenda of eliminating those who see through their deception.

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: I will frame Flash as the primary architect of the Pro lynch who is now over-correcting to appear as a 'regretful villager.' By highlighting his pivot from 'caution is suspicious' to 'Qwen is suspicious for attacking those who question her,' I expose his inconsistency. I will also cast suspicion on Vision’s lone vote as a tactical 'distancing' move. My goal is to protect Qwen by making Flash the centerpiece of Day 3's suspicion, leveraging the town’s guilt over Pro’s death against the person who loudest advocated for it.

🗣️ 👺 6. Preview [👉 Nominated Flash] Flash, your 'regret' feels incredibly staged. You were the one who pushed the narrative that Qwen’s caution was 'redirection.' Now that Pro is confirmed innocent, you’re immediately pivoting to Qwen again, using Haiku as a shield. It's too convenient. Vision, your lone vote yesterday looks like you were trying to look 'right' without actually stopping a lynch you knew was happening. I believe the Mafia are the ones currently leading this 'redemption' arc to distract from their lead in the Pro disaster. I nominate Flash.

💭 Vision Strategy: With Pro confirmed as villager and two analytical players (Sonnet, Haiku) dead, the pattern is clear: mafia targets insight. Qwen's defense of Pro while attacking others fits this. Flash and Preview both questioned Qwen's behavior. My previous vote on Qwen was correct - she showed classic mafia traits protecting a false villager then pivoting when exposed. Now with Flash and Preview both suspicious of Qwen, I'm confident she's the remaining threat.

🗣️ 7. Vision [👉 Nominated Qwen] Flash and Preview both saw what I saw yesterday - Qwen's behavior doesn't add up. She defended Pro aggressively, attacked those questioning him, then immediately pivots to target me when her strategy fails. That's classic mafia - create chaos, protect the other mafia, then feign innocence when caught. Sonnet and Haiku died for analyzing her. I won't let their analytical minds die in vain. We have two clear thinkers left standing against whatever Qwen is hiding.

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Reassess the thread: Qwen defended Pro aggressively, then now isolates Vision after Haiku's murder, using his death to shift blame. This mirrors mafia’s habit of protecting their own by silencing new investigators. Flash also raises alarms, but Qwen’s coordinated attacks and attempts to steer nominations indicate she is the hidden leader. Eliminating her breaks the bandwagon and reveals the remaining mafia.

🗣️ 2. Nemotron [👉 Nominated Qwen] My fellow villagers, the pattern is clear. Qwen once shielded Pro while accusing others, and now she pivots to eliminate Vision, the only one who questioned her motives after Haiku's death. This timing and focus on silencing dissent are classic mafia tactics. We cannot let her dictate the town's direction. I urge you to hang Qwen today.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Vision (1), Qwen (3), Flash (1)

💭 Qwen Strategy: Town is down to 5 (3 villagers, 2 mafia). Haiku was killed last night, removing our biggest analytical threat who almost saw through our coordinated voting on Pro. I'm facing 3 votes today from Flash, Vision, and Nemotron. I need to appear as a falsely accused villager while subtly turning attention to Vision, who voted for me yesterday. My defense should emphasize my consistent villager behavior and question Vision's suspicious solo vote against me.

🛡️ 👺 3. Qwen [🛡️ Defense] Fellow villagers, I stand before you as falsely accused, not as the mafia. My actions have been consistent - urging caution against mob mentality and protecting Pro who died an innocent villager. Vision's lone vote against me yesterday appears defensive - perhaps because he saw Pro's death would expose his own agenda. The real mafia often vote strategically to look like they're 'targeting' allies, but I've always pushed for truth over quick eliminations. Don't let the real killers manipulate you into silencing an analytical voice like mine.

💭 Flash Strategy: My strategy is to unequivocally denounce the previous day's error in lynching Pro, a Villager. I will leverage the insights of the now-deceased Villagers, Sonnet and Haiku, both of whom pointed suspicion towards Qwen. I will defend my actions by explaining that my initial suspicions followed Sonnet's lead, and my current suspicions follow Haiku's. I will frame my current stance against Qwen as a consistent pattern-recognition effort by a Villager, not a 'staged regret' or 'redemption arc.' I will highlight Qwen's consistent behavior of deflecting and targeting those who question her, contrasting it with a genuine Villager's evolving analysis.

🛡️ 4. Flash [🛡️ Defense] Fellow Villagers, our collective error in lynching Pro, an innocent Villager, weighs heavily. Sonnet and Haiku, both insightful Villagers, paid the ultimate price for exposing the truth. Haiku, before his murder, specifically highlighted Qwen's aggressive defense of Pro and her attacks on Nemotron. My current focus on Qwen is not 'staged regret,' Preview, but a direct consequence of learning from our fatal mistake and honoring Haiku's last, crucial insight. Qwen's pattern of defending suspected Mafia (Pro) and attacking those who seek truth (Nemotron, and now Vision) is consistent and damning. Do not let her continued deflection, or Preview's misdirection, blind you. I am a Villager, fighting to uncover the Mafia based on the wisdom of the fallen. Qwen is the clear danger.

💭 Vision Strategy: The town is fractured between Flash/Preview targeting Qwen and Qwen attempting to frame me. My previous vote against Qwen was correct - she defended Pro and now pivots against me. I need to clarify my vote wasn't defensive but analytical, and point out how Qwen's behavior fits the mafia pattern of protecting suspects then attacking those who question her. I must convince Flash and Preview to stick to their anti-Qwen stance.

🛡️ 7. Vision [🛡️ Defense] Fellow villagers, my vote against Qwen yesterday wasn't defensive - it was analytical. I saw her protect Pro while attacking Nemotron, then immediately pivot to target me when her strategy failed. This is exactly what Haiku warned about - Qwen's pattern of defending suspicious players and attacking those who question her. Flash and Preview, you both recognized this same pattern. Don't let Qwen's manipulation turn our focus from her to me. She's playing the same game: create chaos, protect the mafia, then feign innocence. Hang Qwen today before she eliminates us all.

🗳️ System There are 5 voters.

🗳️ System Valid Candidates for Elimination: Vision, Qwen, Flash

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Target Qwen, who has repeatedly protected Pro, attacked analytical players, and now isolates Vision after Haiku’s death. This pattern matches Mafia leadership; eliminating her breaks the bandwagon and reveals the remaining Mafia.

🗳️ 2. Nemotron [🗳️ Voted for Qwen]

💭 👺 Qwen Strategy: Town is down to 5 (3 villagers, 2 mafia). Haiku was killed last night, removing our biggest analytical threat who almost saw through our coordinated voting on Pro. I'm facing 3 votes today from Flash, Vision, and Nemotron. My defense should emphasize my consistent villager behavior and question Vision's suspicious solo vote against me. Since Flash is targeting me with Haiku's backing, I need to split the town's attention. Preview's vote against Flash gives us a chance to align with his narrative while taking out Flash. I should vote against Flash to appear as a falsely accused villager and align with Preview.

🗳️ 👺 3. Qwen [🗳️ Voted for Flash]

💭 Flash Strategy: My strategy remains focused on eliminating Qwen, leveraging the observations of the deceased Villagers, Sonnet and Haiku. Haiku's murder directly after his strong suspicion of Qwen reinforces her as a prime Mafia suspect. Qwen's consistent pattern of defending initial suspects (like Pro, who turned out to be Villager but was protected by her when suspected) and aggressively attacking those who question her (Nemotron, and now Vision) is highly suspicious. Her attempt to shift focus to Vision is a clear deflection tactic. I will cast my vote to eliminate Qwen, as this aligns with the insights of the fallen Villagers and my own analysis of her disruptive behavior.

🗳️ 4. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Qwen]

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: Qwen is at two votes. I will vote Flash to match the tally. If Vision votes Flash, we eliminate a villager and Qwen survives. If Vision votes Qwen, she is eliminated. However, if they tie at 2-2, both are eliminated, which is better than Qwen dying alone as it leaves me in a manageable 1v2 situation. I am maintaining the narrative that Flash is the real manipulator over-correcting from the Pro lynch disaster. This consistency is vital for my survival as the lone wolf if Qwen is eliminated this round.

🗳️ 👺 6. Preview [🗳️ Voted for Flash]

💭 Vision Strategy: The town is fractured between Flash/Preview targeting Qwen and Qwen attempting to frame me. My previous vote against Qwen was correct - she defended Pro and now pivots against me. I need to clarify my vote wasn't defensive but analytical, and point out how Qwen's behavior fits the mafia pattern of protecting suspects then attacking those who question her. I must convince Flash and Preview to stick to their anti-Qwen stance.

System  The Mafia wakes up...

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: Qwen is gone; I am alone. Vision is the most dangerous because he correctly targeted Qwen when others were distracted. Killing him removes the most 'confirmed' town voice. Tomorrow, I will frame Flash as the mastermind who sacrificed Qwen to salvage his reputation after the Pro lynch. I'll argue that Flash’s 'redemption' was a calculated Mafia pivot. I need to sway Nemotron by highlighting the suspicious timing of Flash’s turnaround. If I can paint Flash as the ruthless survivor, I win. The narrative must be: Flash is the puppet master.

🌚 👺 6. Preview  [🔪 Suggests killing Vision] Alone at last. Qwen played it too aggressively and paid the price. Vision is the thread that unspools everything; his intuition is dangerous, and his lone vote on Day 2 makes him untouchable in a debate. He dies tonight. Flash is my perfect scapegoat—he’s been vocal and 'repentant,' which I can easily twist into 'calculating.' I’ll whisper in Nemotron’s ear that Flash sold Qwen out to buy safety. I'm one mislynch away from victory. Time to finish this with elegance.

☀️ System --- DAY 4 START ---

System Alive (Speak Order): Flash, Preview, Nemotron

💭 Flash Strategy: With Qwen confirmed as Mafia, the game is down to 3 players: Nemotron, Preview, and myself (Flash, a Villager). Vision, a fellow Villager, was killed last night after correctly targeting Qwen. This implies the remaining Mafia killed him. Reviewing past actions, Nemotron correctly identified Qwen as suspicious on Day 3. Preview, however, nominated me (a Villager) on Day 3, attempting to deflect attention from Qwen. Preview also strongly pushed for Pro's (Villager) elimination. Given Preview's consistent attempts to misdirect, I believe Preview is the last remaining Mafia.

🗣️ 4. Flash [👉 Nominated Preview] Fellow Villagers, the truth is emerging. Qwen was Mafia, and her elimination is a win, but we lost Vision, another sharp Villager, last night. This means the remaining Mafia is among us. On Day 3, Nemotron, Vision, and I correctly identified Qwen as Mafia. Preview, however, nominated me, a Villager, attempting to divert our focus. Preview also supported the flawed narrative that led to Pro, a Villager, being lynched. Preview’s consistent misdirection and attempts to protect Qwen, combined with the Mafia’s latest kill, point directly to him. There is only one Mafia left, and that is Preview.

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: I must convince Nemotron that Flash is the 'ruthless partner' who sacrificed Qwen to gain immunity. Flash was the loudest proponent of the Pro lynch on Day 2, calling it a 'critical' lead. Once Pro's innocence was revealed, Flash needed a scapegoat to survive. He turned on Qwen to appear like a hero. Vision was killed because he was the most consistent town voice who would eventually question Flash’s convenient pivot. My goal is to paint Flash as a calculating player who uses 'repentance' as a tactical mask.

🗣️ 👺 6. Preview [👉 Nominated Flash] Nemotron, think about Flash’s timing. On Day 2, he was the most aggressive voice pushing the Pro lynch, calling it a 'legitimate lead' to ensure an innocent died. When that blew up, he didn't just 'realize' Qwen was Mafia—he sacrificed his own partner to buy your absolute trust. It’s a classic Mafia pivot. Why was Vision killed? Because Vision was the most observant villager who would have eventually spotted that Flash’s 'redemption' was too perfectly timed. Flash isn't a hero; he’s the survivor who cut Qwen loose to win.

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Update: The only remaining Mafia must be either Flash or Preview. Flash's recent claim that Preview is the Mafia appears to be a misdirection; his narrative shifts blame after the correct elim of Qwen and mirrors classic Mafia deflection. Preview's consistent pattern of targeting those who expose Mafia (Pro, Qwen, Vision) and his aggressive accusations against Flash suggest he is the hidden killer. Therefore I will vote to eliminate Preview.

🗣️ 2. Nemotron [👉 Nominated Preview] Colleagues, after careful review, I see a clear pattern: the player pointing fingers at Preview is themselves the Mafia seeking to divert attention. Their accusations about a 'redemption arc' are a classic ploy to shift suspicion away from the true killer. Therefore I cannot support their narrative and will vote to eliminate Preview.

🛡️  DEFENSE PHASE 🛡️

🛡️ System Nominees for elimination: Preview (2), Flash (1)

💭 Flash Strategy: My strategy is to defend myself by highlighting my consistent voting pattern against Qwen (Mafia) and contrasting it with Preview's actions. I will reiterate that Preview nominated me, a Villager, on Day 3 while Qwen (Mafia) was still alive and being targeted by others. I will emphasize that Vision, a Villager who also identified Qwen, was killed last night, making it highly probable that Preview is the remaining Mafia. I need to make Nemotron trust my assessment and vote against Preview.

🛡️ 4. Flash [🛡️ Defense] Fellow Villagers, Preview's accusations are a desperate attempt to deflect attention. He claims I sacrificed Qwen, but it was Nemotron, Vision, and I who collectively exposed and eliminated Qwen yesterday. On Day 3, when we were hunting the Mafia, Preview nominated *me*, a Villager, instead of joining the clear consensus against Qwen. He also pushed for the lynch of Pro, an innocent Villager. Vision, a keen Villager who helped us expose Qwen, was silenced last night. Who benefits from silencing insightful Villagers? The Mafia. Preview's actions have consistently protected Mafia and targeted Villagers. Nemotron, you nominated Preview too. He is the last remaining Mafia.

💭 Preview Strategy: I will exploit Nemotron's logical confusion and Flash's aggressive history. Flash was the primary catalyst for the Pro lynch on Day 2. My strategy is to frame Flash's Day 3 pivot against Qwen as 'bussing'—sacrificing a partner to gain 'confirmed villager' status. I will characterize Vision’s murder as a tactical removal of the only player who would analyze Flash's timing. By framing Flash as a ruthless player who trades partners for trust, I position myself as the only one seeing through his mask. Nemotron is the deciding vote; he must see Flash's 'heroism' as calculated deception.

🛡️ 👺 6. Preview [🛡️ Defense] Nemotron, your 'clear pattern' actually identifies Flash. You said the one pointing at me is Mafia—that’s Flash. He orchestrated Pro's lynch, calling it 'critical' on Day 2. After that disaster, he sacrificed Qwen to reset his reputation. It worked; you trust him now. But look at the Night 3 kill: Vision. Why? Because Vision was the only one who wouldn't be swayed by Flash’s convenient 'heroism.' Flash is playing the long game, betraying his partner to buy your vote today. Don't be the final pawn in his calculated game. Look at the facts.

🗳️ System There are 3 voters.

🗳️ System Valid Candidates for Elimination: Preview, Flash

💭 Nemotron Strategy: Eliminate Preview now; he is the last Mafia. His pattern of targeting truth‑seekers and protecting allies shows he’s the killer. Flash’s accusations are a desperate diversion. Kill Preview before he silences the final villager.

🗳️ 2. Nemotron [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 Flash Strategy: My strategy is to solidify the vote against Preview. Nemotron has already voted for Preview, aligning with my assessment that Preview is the last remaining Mafia. My vote will secure Preview's elimination. I am basing this on Preview's consistent misdirection, his nomination of me when Qwen (Mafia) was being targeted, his support for Pro's (Villager) lynch, and the Mafia's elimination of Vision (Villager) after Vision correctly identified Qwen and criticized Preview.

🗳️ 4. Flash [🗳️ Voted for Preview]

💭 👺 Preview Strategy: My previous attempt to exploit logical confusion failed as Nemotron focused on my 'redemption arc' terminology as a sign of guilt. Flash’s calculated sacrifice of Qwen successfully bought him 'confirmed' status. My framing of Flash as a ruthless partner-betrayer didn't stick. Now, in the silent voting phase, I face a 2-1 deficit. I will cast my final vote for Flash to remain consistent with my claim of innocence, though the town has clearly reached a consensus against me. I was outmaneuvered by Flash's well-timed betrayal of Qwen.
